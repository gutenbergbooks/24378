<h1><span class="sp1">MAMMA'S</span><br />
STORIES ABOUT BIRDS.</h1>

<h2>THE EAGLE.</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> Eagle is often called the King of Birds, and
therefore it is of him that we ought to speak first.
Very likely you have often seen eagles in the
Zoological Gardens, and, if so, you know what
noble looking birds they are. But they seem very
sad in their prison-houses, to which no kindness
can ever attach them. They are formed to soar
boldly to the top of some lonely mountain height,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and there dwell far from the abode of men. And
to chain them down upon a stunted branch, within
reach of all who like to go and gaze upon them,
seems treating them unworthily. One can almost
fancy that they show by their sullen, brooding
attitude, and sparkling eyes, how much they feel
themselves degraded and out of place. I cannot
tell you that the Eagle is of any real service to
man, but every one who has been out amongst
the mountains, reckons it a fine sight if he can
catch a glimpse of one or more of these noble
birds soaring in the air. Eagles are found in
every country where there are mountains. In
Ireland, and sometimes in England and Scotland,
the large golden eagle is found, and is a very
fine bird. In America there is an eagle called
the Bird of Washington, which is so large that
its wings spread out from seven to ten feet. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
body of the bird is not so very much larger than
a goose; but, as this eagle can fly as many as 140
miles in an hour, it wants very large strong wings
to bear it onwards. The North American Indians&mdash;you
have heard of them, have you not?&mdash;fine
handsome looking men they are, though copper-coloured;
and in former times before Columbus
first found out America, the whole of that vast
continent belonged to the Indians and had no
other inhabitants;&mdash;well, these men have a great
feeling of reverence for the eagle. They admire
him very much, because he is bold, active, watchful,
and patient in bearing with want. All these
qualities the Indians value in men, and they say
the eagle is noble above all birds because he possesses
them. But for all that they kill him, and
will watch for days to get a chance of shooting
their prize. And they think his feathers the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
very finest ornament they can wear, and on grand
occasions the chiefs deck themselves with eagles'
plumes as a sign of their rank. These feathers
are also used by them in making arrows. For
the feathers of the eagle do not get spoiled by
wet or pressure, as those of other birds would
do, but always remain firm and strong.</p>

<p>Another eagle is called the Erne, White-tailed,
or Sea Eagle. These birds live near the sea-shore,
and feed upon fish. Their sight is so piercing
that they can mark a fish swimming far below
them as they hover over the water, and, pouncing
down, will strike their strong talons into it, and
steer themselves and their prey ashore by their
great outspread wings. The African Eagle is
said to be very generous in his disposition, and
certainly deserves to be called kingly. Although
he will not allow any large bird to dwell in peace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
too near him, yet he never harms the little
warblers who flutter round his nest. He will
let them perch in safety upon it, and if they
are attacked by any bird of prey, he is said even
to fly to their protection.</p>

<p>The eagle is, however, himself a bird of
prey, and is often found a very troublesome
neighbour. Hares, rabbits, poultry, nay, even
lambs have been carried off by these powerful
birds, for when excited by hunger they will
attack even those creatures which are larger
than themselves. Deer and even oxen have been
pounced upon by eagles and buffeted about the
head until they fell down quite helpless, but there
are not many instances of this kind. We are
also told of little children who have been carried
up into their nests by the old birds as food for
their young; and one very old story of the kind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
taken from an old book in English history, I
must tell you. "Alfred, king of the West
Saxons, went out one day a hunting, and, passing
by a certain wood, heard as he supposed the
cry of an infant, from the top of a tree, and
forthwith diligently inquiring of the huntsmen
what that doleful sound could be, commanded
one of them to climb the tree, when in the
top of it was found an eagle's nest, and lo!
therein a pretty sweet-faced infant, wrapped up
in a purple mantle, and upon each arm a bracelet
of gold, a clear sign that he was born of noble
parents. Whereupon the king took charge of
him, and caused him to be baptized, and because
he was found in a nest, he gave him the name
of Nestringam, and in after time, having nobly
educated him, he advanced him to the dignity
of an earl."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Eagles are said to be very long lived; one died
at Vienna that had lived in confinement more
than one hundred years. Their cry consists of
two notes, uttered in a loud sharp key. They
make a flat nest, formed of loose sticks, on the top
of some solitary rock where they are not likely to
be disturbed, and lay two eggs. Whilst the
young are not able to fly, they are carefully fed by
the parent birds, who are then more fierce than
usual, and forage everywhere for food, carrying
off fawns, lambs, hares, &amp;c., never, if possible,
touching any animal already dead. Smith, in his
history of Kerry, a county in Ireland, tells us of
a poor man then living there, who got "a comfortable
subsistence for his family during a summer
of famine, out of an eagle's nest, by robbing the
eaglets of the food the old ones brought." And
lest he should lose this supply too soon, he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
clever enough to cut the wings of the young birds
when they were old enough to fly, so that the
unsuspecting parents went on feeding them much
longer than usual. Mr. Dunn says he once saw,
while shooting on Rona's Hill, a pair of skua
gulls chase and completely beat off a large sea
eagle. The gulls struck at him several times,
and at each stroke he screamed loudly, but never
offered to return the assault.</p>

THE DUCK.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE DUCK.</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">There</span> is so much that is interesting to tell you
about the duck, that I scarcely know where to
begin. Most of you know something of the
habits of the tame or domestic duck. But
perhaps you have never noticed its curious bill,
which is constructed so as to filter, through its
toothed edges, the soft mud in which these birds
love to dabble. The tongue of the duck is full of
nerves, so that its sense of taste is very keen, and
thus provided the bird can find out all that is
savoury to its palate in puddles, ponds, etc., and
throwing away all that is tasteless, swallow only
what it likes. Try and examine the bill of the
next duck that you see, and you will discover this
wonderful apparatus which I have described as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
acting like a filter. The duck is very capable of
affection for its owners, as the following fact will
show. A farmer's wife had a young duck, which
by some accident was deprived of its companions.
From that moment all its love seemed to centre
upon its mistress. Wherever she went the duck
followed, and that so closely, that she was in
constant fear of crushing it to death. With its
age its affections seemed to strengthen, and it
took up its abode in-doors, basking on the hearth,
and delighting in notice. After some time other
ducks were procured, and, to induce it to mix
with its natural companions, the pet duck was
driven out day by day; but there was great
difficulty in weaning it from the kind friend to
whom it had attached itself. We are told also of
some ducklings who grew so fond of a great,
savage house-dog, that though every one else was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
afraid of him, they showed no fear of his terrible
bark; but, on the first approach of danger, would
rush in a body to his side, and take shelter in his
kennel. Wild ducks, or mallards, are very
abundant in marshy places, and are a source of
great profit. They are in some parts shot by
means of a long gun which will kill at a greater
distance than usual, because the duck, besides
being very watchful and timid, has a keen sense
of smell and hearing. In other places they are
caught by decoys. These are thus contrived.
A number of ducks, trained for the purpose, are
employed to lead the wild fowl on and on through
narrow wicker channels up to a funnel net.
Hemp-seed is thrown in their way, as they
advance, by the decoy-man, whose whistle is
obeyed by the decoy-ducks, until the poor
strangers are quite entrapped.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>China is said to be a wonderful place for
rearing ducks, and, indeed, all poultry, but in
Canton many people gain a good livelihood by
bringing up ducks in particular. The eggs are
hatched in ovens, and then the young ones are
brought up by people who buy them from the
hatchers. Sometimes the heat has been too
great, and then the little ducks, even if hatched
at all, soon die. The way by which those who
buy them find out whether they are likely to live,
is by holding them up by their beaks. If the
heat has not been too great, they will sprawl out
their little wings and feet, but if hatched too
soon they hang motionless. They are fed on
boiled rice, herbs, and little fish, chopped small.
When old enough to learn to swim, they are put
under the care of a clever old duck, trained to the
business. A number of these ducks with their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
broods are sent down to the river in a sort of
floating pen. In the evening a whistle, which
the ducks well know, recalls them to the boat in
which they were sent out. The instant this is
heard the ducks come trooping in as fast as
possible, followed by their pupils. In order to
encourage them to be punctual, the first duck is
rewarded with something nice, but the last one is
whipped for its laziness. And it is said to be
very funny to see how the ducks will waddle, and
run, and fly over each other's backs, that they
may escape the punishment which they know
awaits the last straggler.</p>

<p>As to the <i>use</i> we make of ducks, it is chiefly as
an article of food the English duck is prized.
But in the Northern regions, particularly in
Iceland, there is a bird called the eider duck,
which is much valued on account of the soft and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
beautiful down which grows upon its breast, and
is used for pillows and counterpanes, being
wonderfully light, warm and elastic. These
birds, though naturally solitary creatures, assemble
in crowds at the breeding season, and
build their nests in the roofs of the houses.
They tear away this soft down as a cradle for
their young. But the people rob the nests when
they are finished, not only once, but sometimes,
cruelly enough, a second time. For the poor
birds, finding the down gone, tear a second
supply from their loving bosoms. If the plunder
be attempted more than twice, the birds are said
to forsake the spot entirely. The eider duck has
a curious method of teaching her young ones to
swim. A few days after they are hatched she
carries them some distance from shore on her
back. Then, making a sudden dive, she leaves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the little ones afloat and obliged to exert their
own powers. Re-appearing at a little distance,
she entices them towards her, and thus they at
once become good swimmers.</p>

<p>Before concluding, I will relate an instance of
the sagacity often displayed by the tame or domestic
duck. It is told by a gentleman named
Mr. Saul:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have now a fine duck which was hatched
under a hen, there being seven young ones produced
at the time. When these ducks were about
ten days old, five of them were taken away from
beneath the hen by the rats, during the nighttime,
the rats sucking them to death and leaving
the body perfect. My duck, which escaped this
danger, now alarms all the other ducks and the
fowls in the most extraordinary manner, as soon as
rats appear in the building in which they are confined,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
whether it be in the night or the morning.
I was awakened by this duck about midnight,
and as I feared the rats were making an attack, I
got up immediately, went to the building, and
found the ducks uninjured. I then returned to
bed, supposing the rats had retreated. To my
surprise, next morning, I found that two young
ducks had been taken from beneath a hen and
sucked to death, at a very short distance from
where the older duck was sitting. On this account,
I got a young rat dog, and kept it in the
building, and when the rats approach, the duck
will rouse the dog from sleep, and as soon as the
dog starts up, the duck resettles herself."</p>

THE QUAIL.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE QUAIL.</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> quail is the smallest of the poultry tribe, and
is a pretty little bird, something like a partridge,
but not so large. I dare say you have sometimes
seen quails alive in a poulterer's shop, where they
are often displayed in long narrow cages, and are
sadly crowded together. The quail is a migratory
bird, except in those countries blessed with an
equable temperature, such as Italy, Portugal, etc.,
where it is to be found in all seasons. In warm
weather the quail visits our island, but nearly all
those sold in London are brought from France,
where they are caught in hundreds by means of
a quail-pipe as it is called. This is a little
instrument which imitates the cry or call of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
quail so successfully that the bird is deceived,
and, following the note, is easily ensnared.
Africa is the head-quarters of quails in the
winter, but in the summer they come in vast
flocks and take up their abode in Europe and
Asia. In the Crimea and Egypt they are caught
in immense numbers whilst exhausted by their
long flight. We are told in Stade's Travels in
Turkey, that, "near Constantinople in the migrating
season, the sun is often nearly obscured by
the prodigious flights of quails, which alight on
the coasts of the Black Sea, near the Bosphorus,
and are caught by means of nets spread on high
poles, planted along the cliff, some yards from its
edge, against which the birds, exhausted by their
passage over the sea, strike themselves and fall."
The Arabs also catch quails by thousands in nets,
when they visit Egypt, about harvest time. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
observations of modern travellers have confirmed
in a very interesting manner the account given
us of quails in the Bible. Do not you remember
reading of the multitude of quails that were sent
by God as food for the children of Israel whilst
wandering in the desert, when they grew tired of
the sweet manna God had rained upon them from
heaven, and desired flesh? "They gathered the
quails," we are told, in great quantities, "and
they spread them all abroad for themselves round
about the camp."&mdash;Numbers xi. 32. This was
done in order to dry them, and this method of
preserving not only quails, but other flesh and
fish, is still followed by the Arabs. There is one
particular island off the coast of Egypt where
myriads of quails are caught, and, being stripped
of their feathers, are dried in the burning sand
for about a quarter of an hour, after which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
are sold for as little as a penny a pound. The
crews of those vessels which in that season lie in
the adjacent harbour, have no other food allowed
them. The quails, when migrating, fly so near
the ground that they are very easily knocked
down and secured. The nest of the quail is very
simple. It consists merely of a few dried sticks
in a wheat-field, and contains from twelve to
eighteen pretty little green and brown eggs.
The quail itself is very prettily coloured with
black, chestnut, yellow, and white, and the males
have a black collar round their throats. The old
Romans would not eat the flesh of the quail,
because it feeds on the grains of a poisonous
plant. But we moderns are not so scrupulous,
and find it very delicious food. I am sorry to
tell you this little bird is so fond of fighting
that there was an old proverb, "as quarrelsome as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
quails in a cage." And the Greeks and Romans
kept quails on purpose to see them fight, as some
people did formerly (I hope not now), game-cocks.
Even to this day this is the custom in India and
China.</p>

<p>I always like to conclude with a pretty story
for you if I can, but I can find nothing likely to
amuse you about the quail, except the following
account of the Virginian quail, related by a
gentleman residing in Canada. He "happened
to have above a hundred at one period alive, and
took much pleasure in the evening, watching their
motions where they were confined. As it grew
dusk, the birds formed themselves into coveys or
parties of twelve or fifteen in a circle, the heads
out and tails clustered in the centre. One bird
always stood guard to each party, and remained
perfectly stationary for half an hour, when, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
particular <i>cluck</i> being given, another sentinel
immediately took his place, and relieved him with
as much regularity as any garrison could boast.
It became a matter of further curiosity to observe
how they would meet the extra duty occasioned
by the havoc of the <i>cook</i>. For this also a remedy
was found, and the gentleman remarked with
admiration that, as their number decreased, the
period of watch was extended from a half to a
whole hour, in the same form, and with unfailing
regularity."</p>

THE ROBIN REDBREAST.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE ROBIN REDBREAST.</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Every</span> little boy and girl well knows this pretty
little bird. His bright eyes and rosy breast
delight us even before we hear his lovely song.
And do you not remember that when the babes
in the wood were left alone, to die, by that cruel
robber, after wandering about till they were so
weary that they lay down and slept the sleep of
death, it was the Robin Redbreast who "painfully
did cover them with leaves." One would think
the robin must be very fond of little boys and
girls. One thing I am sure of, and that is that
they love him very dearly, that they delight in
the very sound of his name, that they scatter
crumbs upon the window sill for him in winter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and that they would not disturb his nest for all
the world.</p>

<p>Robins are not very often to be seen in the
summer, for they fly far into the depths of woods
and lonely places to rear their young. So amongst
the chorus of sweet singers who make melody
when leaves are green it is not very common to
hear the voice of the robin, though he is said to
sing very constantly by the side of his mate,
whilst she sits upon her eggs or broods over her
young ones. But in autumn, Robin comes nearer
the abode of man, and it is difficult then in
country places to skirt a field or wander in a lane,
without seeing a brisk little bird with ruby breast
perched upon the hedgerow, pouring forth a
sweet and gentle song. This is the robin, and
we love his notes all the more at a time when
few other birds still sing. Nay, even in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
winter when, the Nightingale and many other
warblers have left our shores to spend the chilly
months in some warmer climate, the robin only
draws nearer to our homes, makes his abode
in our gardens, pecks up the crumbs at our
very doors, nay, often finds his way into our
houses, and rewards every kindness shewn to him
with the same sweet flood of song that he poured
forth amidst the woods in the days of summer.
Many very pretty stories are told of different
robins who have been tamed by kindness until
they seemed to lose almost all that fear of man
which is generally so striking in birds.</p>

<div class="blockquot">"The birds of heaven before us fleet."</div>

<p class="noin">I have heard of one who came to live almost
entirely in the chamber of a sick gentleman, and
grew very fond of ground rice pudding, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
was a favourite invalid dish. But the out-door
feeding of robins is not so dainty in general, and
I am sorry to tell you that, by those who have
taken pains to watch robins, and study their wild
habits, these birds are found not only to prey on
live worms, which is natural enough, but also to
spend much time and trouble to prepare the poor
things for food, in a way that must be any thing
but agreeable to the victims. For the robin
does not eat the whole worm, only the outer skin,
and, to get rid of the inner part, Mr. Robin takes
the worm in his bill and dashes it about on a
stone with great skill until he has effected his
purpose. He is also a very pugnacious bird; that
is he is very fond of fighting, I am sorry to tell
you, but such is really the case. He will not
allow other robins to build in the same bush with
him. He never joins himself in friendly company<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
with his fellows, and on occasion he can fight
very heartily: so heartily that a lady who writes
much that is delightful, of birds, and amongst
them of robins, tells the following story. She
was once sitting with a family party, when a
cat rushed in with two robins in her mouth,
which she had pounced upon in the garden whilst
they were engaged in such a desperate battle that
they did not see their enemy at hand. One head
stuck out at each side of puss's mouth, but of
course she was instantly seized and forced to let
go her prey, when both robins flew away as if not
much hurt. But for all this Robin Redbreast is a
very charming little fellow, and well deserves a
warm place in your regard.</p>

<p>Some years ago a pair of robins took up their
abode in the parish church of Hampton, in
Warwickshire, and affixed their nest to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
church Bible as it lay on the reading desk. The
vicar would not allow the birds to be disturbed,
and, therefore, provided another Bible. Another
instance is related where a clerk, in Wiltshire,
found a robin's nest, containing two eggs, under
the Bible on the reading desk. The bird was
not disturbed, and laid four more, which were
hatched in due season. The cock-bird actually
brought food in its bill and fed the young brood
during Divine service.</p>

THE BULLFINCH.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE BULLFINCH.</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Look</span> at the bright colours of this beautiful little
bird: you can scarcely find one with prettier
plumage or a sweeter note. His native song is not
very remarkable, but he is so docile, and so readily
taught to whistle different airs, that he is highly
valued. Bullfinches are common enough in our
woods and gardens, but gardeners are sad enemies
to these little birds, declaring that they spoil trees
by picking off their buds. It is, however, now
thought by intelligent persons that the only buds
destroyed by the bullfinch are those infested with
insects, so that he really confers a benefit on us
instead of doing mischief. Almost all the piping
bullfinches as they are called, kept in cages in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
this country, are brought from Germany, where
much care is devoted to their instruction in the
art of music. In their education the following
method is pursued. "The birds are taken from
the nests of wild ones when about ten days old,
and are brought up by a person who is very kind
and attentive to them, so that they very soon
grow gentle and tame. As soon as they begin to
whistle their studies commence, they being then
about two months' old. Formed into classes of
six or so, they are kept a little while hungry and
in the dark, whilst the tune they are to learn is
played over to them on a bird-organ, which has a
sort of bird-like note. Over and over again the
same air is repeated, until, one by one, the birds
begin to imitate what they hear. Directly they
do this, light is admitted, and they have a little
food given to them. By this means the birds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
learn to think of the tune and their dinners at
the same time, and directly they hear the organ
will begin to whistle. They are then turned over
to the care of boys, whose sole business it is to go
on with their education, each boy having a
separate bird placed under his charge, and he
plays away from morning to night, or as long as
the birds can pay attention, during which time
their first teacher, or feeder, goes his rounds,
scolding or rewarding his feathered scholars by
signs and modes which he has taught them to
understand, until they become so perfect, and the
tune, whatever it may be, so imprinted on their
memory, that they will pipe it for the remainder
of their lives."</p>

<p>Bullfinches that are perfect in their song, are
worth a great deal of money. Both the male
and female sing, but the colours of the male are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the brightest. These birds, however, in confinement,
lose their brilliancy of hue, and, from
growing duskier and duskier, sometimes become
entirely black, as if putting on mourning for
their lost liberty. The same change has been
observed in a bird which lost its mate to whom
it had been tenderly attached. It is principally
for its power of imitation and memory that this
bird is prized. His wild notes, when loud, are
not particularly sweet, but at times are very soft
and plaintive.</p>

<p>I will conclude with a pretty and affecting
little story of a piping bullfinch that once belonged
to Sir William Parsons. When young he was a
great musician, and had taught his bullfinch to
sing "God Save the King." On going abroad,
he committed his feathered friend to the care of
his sister, with many injunctions to be watchful
of its health and happiness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>On his return she told him the little bird had
seemed pining away, and was then very ill.
Grieved to hear this news, Sir William went at
once to the room where it was kept, and, putting
his hand into the cage, called the little creature.
It knew the voice of the dear master for whom it
had so pined and, opening its eyes and shaking
its disordered feathers, as if to do him honour,
staggered on to his finger, piped "God Save the
King," and then fell dead.</p>

<h2>THE ALBATROSS.</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">This</span> is the largest of all sea-birds, and you are
not very likely to make acquaintance with him
except in a picture. For though the albatross
has been seen in our latitudes, yet the southern
seas are his native home. There he spreads his
long wings and floats over the ocean like a white
sea-king. The greater part of his feathers are
white, but the head and back are shaded with
grey. There are many kinds of albatross, but
the great Wandering Albatross, as it is called, is
the largest, and though the body is not much
bigger than that of a pelican, the wings, which
are long and narrow, have been known to measure
as much as fourteen feet across when fully expanded,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
or spread out. Must he not look a noble
bird, sailing as he does calmly round and round,
far up in the air, over those southern seas? From
the length of his wings, the albatross has some
little trouble in raising himself from the surface
of the water, where he often floats at rest. He
has to skim along half flying and half running for
some distance, until his wings are clear of the
water; then he soars away, seldom flapping his
wings, but rising, sinking, and floating through
the air, as if kept up by some internal power.
As he seldom is obliged to flap his wings he does
not get tired of flying, and can remain on the
wing for a very, very long time, pursuing his prey,
or enjoying the sailing motion through the air.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>
<img src="images/009.png" width="512" height="500" alt="" title="" />
THE ALBATROSS.</div>

<p>The albatross feeds on fish or on smaller sea-fowl,
and is a very voracious bird; that is, he
will eat a great quantity, and devours in a greedy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
way. His chief food consists of flying-fish, as they
are called. The flying-fish is a little like the
common herring, but much prettier, for it is
covered with bright blue and silver scales, and its
fins are also a brilliant azure. It does not really
fly. That is, it has no wings, but it has very
large strong fins attached near its gills, by means
of which it can spring out of the water and dart
some distance through the air. This fish is very
nice eating, <i>particularly</i> good, and it is sought
after very eagerly by larger fish. And not only
by fish; the water-fowl who are large enough to
eat it, are always on the watch for the flying-fish,
and as the poor thing springs from the water to
enjoy the bright sunshine and fresh air, or perhaps
to escape some of its under-water foes, especially
the dolphin who is one of its deadliest enemies,
it frequently finds itself snapped up by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
albatross before it can return to its native element.
The albatross loves also to follow in the wake of
ships. For any offal or garbage thrown overboard
is welcome to its hungry maw, and sailors
do not often destroy this bird. When one is
taken, however, they hesitate not to make such
use of it as they can; and the large web feet,
when cleaned and opened, are favourite tobacco
pouches. I have one by me that was taken from
a large albatross caught on the voyage from
Australia. In Kamtschatka the albatross is caught
by the natives and made useful. For in the
summer, flocks of these birds make their way up
into the northern latitudes, as is supposed in
order to prey on the shoals of fish which migrate
thither.</p>

<p>The albatross is caught by means of a hook
baited with a fish. The "intestines are blown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and used as buoys for nets, and the long hollow
wing bones as tobacco pipes," but the flesh is not
good to eat. The albatross has been seen fully
1000 miles from any shore. Its power of wing
must therefore be very great, but when tired it
can walk on the water with its strong webbed
feet, and the sound of its tread is said to be heard
at a great distance. In the breeding season the
albatross retires in company with other sea-birds,
particularly the penguin, to some rocky shore to
build its nest. The penguins' and albatrosses'
nests are always found in company, but the
penguin robs his neighbour in order to get the
scanty materials which are necessary for his own
nest. The male albatross takes turns with his
mate in hatching the young.</p>

<p>A poor sailor once fell over board from a man-of-war
in the Southern Indian Ocean. In an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
instant he was attacked by two or three albatrosses,
and though the ship's boat was immediately
lowered to his assistance, nothing of him could be
found but his hat, which was pierced through and
through by the strong beak of the albatross, the
first blow having no doubt penetrated to his
brain and killed him.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE OWL.</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">This</span> solemn looking bird is seldom to be seen by
day. It is strictly a night bird. Its eyes are
unable to endure the glare of sunshine, but are
formed for seeing in the dim twilight, or in the
soft radiance of the moon. There are at least
eighty different species of owls. This picture
resembles most nearly the Virginian Eagle Owl,
an American bird. Our common barn-door owl
has no tufts on its head. Some people are foolish
and cruel enough to persecute owls, under the
plea that they do mischief, destroy pigeon's eggs,
etc. But this is a false charge. On the contrary
they are very actively useful creatures, and the
humane naturalist, Mr. Waterton, says that "if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
this useful bird caught his food by day instead of
hunting it by night, mankind would have ocular
demonstration of its utility in thinning the
country of mice, and it would be protected and
encouraged everywhere. It would be with us
what the ibis was with the Egyptians." The
ibis is a bird that was found so useful in destroying
locusts and serpents in Egypt, that in olden times
it was made a capital crime for any one to destroy
it. Nay, the idolatrous Egyptians went further,
and not only paid divine honours to this bird,
worshipping it as a deity whilst alive, but embalmed
its body after death, and preserved it in
the form of a mummy. You may see many ibis
mummies in the Egyptian rooms of the British
Museum. Through God's goodness there is no
danger of our going quite so far as the Egyptians
even if we did do justice to the poor abused owl,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and it is very much to be wished that people
would learn to see its valuable qualities. There
is no doubt owls are amongst the creatures given
to us by God to do us real service in keeping
down the increase of smaller animals, that would
otherwise soon over-run and destroy our food.
But as Mr. Waterton elsewhere says, prejudices
are hard to overcome, and I suppose the poor owl
will be hunted and killed, whenever he is to be
found by the ignorant, to the end of the chapter.
Some idea may be formed of the rapid clearance
an owl would make of vermin from a barn, from
the fact that, when he has young, he will bring a
mouse to the nest every twelve or fifteen minutes.
Mr. Waterton saw his barn owl fly off with a rat
he had just shot. And at another time she
plunged into the water and brought up in her
claws a fish, which she carried away to her nest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
The Barn Owl is white, and does not hoot, at
least by many this is thought to be the case.
The Brown Owl is the hooting or screech owl,
and makes a very dismal noise.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 470px;"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>
<img src="images/010.png" width="470" height="500" alt="" title="" />
THE OWL.</div>

<p>The owl can do without drinking for a very
long time. Mr. White, of Selborne, says he
knew a Brown Owl to live a whole year without
water. The owl swallows its prey whole when
small, and afterwards brings up from its crop the
fur, bones, and other parts that cannot easily be
digested, in the form of a round cake. Hawks
are said to do the same thing.</p>

<p>The great Virginian Owl is of an immense size,
and its cry is said to be very terrible when heard
in the lonely American forests, resembling at
times the last struggling scream of a person being
throttled. Owls will eat raw meat, but their
favourite food consists in young mice, and they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
may often be seen at twilight, hunting like
sporting dogs round the meadow paths for field-mice
which come out at that hour, and going
back every five minutes or so to their nests, to see
that all is well at home.</p>

<p>If by chance an owl appears in daylight, he is
immediately attacked by all the smaller birds,
who know their enemy, and feel pleasure in
insulting him when he cannot revenge himself.
For the owl grows so confused if he lingers
abroad till the sun has risen, that he cannot find
his way back to his nest, nor make head against
his pursuers, as he would soon do in the dim
twilight. Bird fanciers have been known to take
advantage of this circumstance in Italy, and tying
an owl to a tree in daylight, they lime all the
surrounding branches. Troops of little birds soon
find out their helpless foe, and hurrying to attack<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
him with their little beaks and claws, they perch
on the limed twigs, and are taken by scores.</p>

<p>The Snowy Owl inhabits the north of Europe,
but is sometimes seen in more southern regions.
It pursues hares, of which it is particularly fond,
and often snatches fish from the water, over which
it slowly sails, with a sudden grasp of its foot.
It often also accompanies sportsmen, that it may
share in the sport. In winter, when this owl is
fat, the Indians esteem the Snowy owl to be
good eating. Its flesh is delicately white.</p>

<h2>THE GOOSE.</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Have</span> you not often heard people say "as silly as
a goose"? Now I am going to tell you that the
goose is one of the most sensible birds we know,
and not only sensible, but very affectionate, and
exceedingly useful to man. I will tell you some
stories of Mrs. Goose presently, which will show
you her real character. But I must begin with
her uses. The goose is to be found in almost
every country, and its flesh is very good eating;
but it is principally for its feathers and quills that
it is valued here. The quills, from which our
pens, and in part our paint brushes, are made, are
plucked from the pinions of the goose, and the
best featherbeds and pillows are stuffed with her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
feathers. Geese love water and marshy places,
and Lincolnshire, which is a fenny place, is famous
for breeding them. People there make it their
business to keep perhaps as many as a thousand
geese, which, in the course of a year, will increase
seven-fold, the geese being kept in the houses,
and even bedrooms, of their owners whilst hatching,
and a person called a gozzard having the
charge of them. They are plucked, poor things,
for their feathers as often as five times a year,
and for their quills once. Even the young goslings
of six weeks' old are deprived of their tail
feathers, in order, as it is said, to accustom them
to this cruel operation. When ready for the
London market, the geese are marched slowly up
from Lincolnshire to London, in flocks of from
two to nine thousand. Being slow travellers,
they are on foot from three in the morning to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
nine in the evening, and during that time get
through about nine miles.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 488px;"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>
<img src="images/011.png" width="488" height="500" alt="" title="" />
THE GOOSE.</div>

<p>Amongst the Romans this bird was held sacred
to Juno, their supreme heathen goddess; indeed,
it appears to have been looked upon with reverence
by all ancient nations, and not longer ago than
the time of the Crusades, a goose was carried as a
standard from our own country by an irregular
band of crusaders. Possibly in former times the
good qualities of the goose were better known
than now; for the sagacity and affection of this
bird have been proved by so many well authenticated
instances, that I am at a loss which to
select for your entertainment, and must try to
choose those you are least likely to have met with
already. As a proof of the goose's sagacity, is
the following. A goose begun to sit on six or
eight eggs, when the dairy maid, thinking she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
could hatch a larger number, put in as many duck
eggs, which could scarcely be distinguished from
the others. On visiting the nest next morning, all
the duck eggs were found put out of the nest on
the ground. They were replaced, but the next morning
were again found picked out and laid outside,
whilst the goose remained sitting on the whole of
her own eggs. Lest she should abandon the nest
altogether, she was not troubled with the strange
eggs again, but allowed to rear her own children
in peace. There are a vast number of stories told
of singular and strong attachments formed by
geese to people. We hear of one old gander who
used to lead his old blind mistress to church, graze
in the churchyard during the service (for I ought
to have told you that geese eat grass like oxen),
and then lead her home again. A goose attached
itself so strongly to its master that it forsook for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
him the society of its fellows, followed him wherever
he went, even through the crowded streets,
sat, if allowed, upon his lap, and responded with
a cry of delight to every sound of his voice. Even
to other animals the goose has been known to
show strong affection. There was once a goose
who had been saved by a dog from the ravenous
jaws of a fox. She seemed from that time to
centre all her affection on her preserver, left the
poultry yard for his side, tried to bite any one at
whom she heard him bark, and, if driven away
into the field, would sit all day at the gate from
which she could gaze on her friend. The dog at
last fell ill, but the faithful goose would not leave
him, and would have died, for want of food, at his
side had not corn been put near the kennel. The
dog died, but she would not leave the kennel, and
I am sorry to tell you that when a new dog was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
brought, very much like the old one, as she ran to
greet him, hoping it was her old friend restored,
he seized her by the neck and put an end to her
faithful life. One more story I must tell you,
though I have already said so much. A game
cock had cruelly attacked a goose on her nest, and
even pecked out one of her eyes. The gander
took his mate's part, and fought over and over
again with the enemy. One day, during his absence,
the game cock attacked the goose again,
when the gander, hearing a noise, ran up, and,
seizing the cock, dragged him into the pond
where he ducked him repeatedly until he had
made an end of him. In Russia, ganders are
taught to fight each other, and a trained gander
has been known to sell for twenty pounds.</p>

<p>There is a very beautiful goose called the
Egyptian Goose, or goose of the Nile. Its feathers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
are very handsomely marked with black, brown,
green, and white. It is the goose so often represented,
in old fresco paintings of heathen temples,
by the ancients. This goose is famous for its
devotion to its young. The old birds will remain
with their offspring during times of most imminent
danger, refusing to save themselves and leave
their young in peril.</p>

<p>The Canada Goose is also another prettily-marked
variety of goose. And although not a
native of this country, its migratory habits often
bring it to this shore.</p>

THE MAGPIE.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE MAGPIE.</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> Magpie is a very pretty and cunning bird.
It is easy to teach it to speak, and it may be rendered
very tame. Where high trees abound, the
magpie chooses the very highest and most difficult
to climb for its nest. But otherwise, when secure
of not being injured, it will often build in low
bushes round about houses. This is particularly
the case in Norway and Sweden, where an idea
prevails that it is unlucky to kill them.</p>

<p>An interesting account is given by a gentleman
of a pair of magpies that built for several successive
years in a gooseberry bush near a house in
Scotland, where there were no trees for a considerable
distance. In order to secure themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
from cats, &amp;c., they brought briars and thorns in
quantities all round the bush, and pulled rough
prickly sticks so closely and in such numbers in
amongst the branches, that even a man would have
found the greatest difficulty in getting at their
soft warm little abode within. The barrier all
round was more than a foot thick. They were
kindly protected by the family to whom the garden
belonged, but one day the hen magpie was ungrateful
enough to seize a little chicken, which
she carried up to the top of the house to eat; the
poor little thing screamed loudly. But the hen,
who can be brave enough when her young are in
danger, hearing the cry, flew to the rescue, and
soon obtained possession of her chick, which she
brought safely down in her beak; nor did it utter
one cry then, though I daresay mamma pinched
it sadly. I think I can find you one more pleasing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
story of the magpie. Some boys once took a
raven's nest and put it in a waggon in a cart-shed.
A magpie, whose nest they had also plundered,
hearing the young birds cry, came to them with
food, and continued to supply the little ravens
until they were given away by the boys.</p>

<p>In Sweden, as I said before, neither the magpie
nor its eggs are ever touched, whilst Mr. Hewitson,
writing of Norway, says: "The magpie is one of
the most abundant, as well as the most interesting
of the Norwegian birds; noted for its sly, cunning
habits here, its altered demeanour there is the
more remarkable. It is upon the most familiar
terms with the inhabitants, picking close about
their doors, and sometimes walking inside their
houses. It abounds in the town of Drontheim,
making its nest upon the churches and warehouses.
We saw as many as a dozen of them at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
one time seated upon the gravestones in the
churchyard. Few farm-houses are without several
of them breeding under the eaves, their nest supported
by the spout. In some trees close to
houses their nests were several feet in depth, the
accumulation of years of undisturbed and quiet
possession."</p>

THE PHEASANT.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE PHEASANT.</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">This</span> beautiful bird comes originally from the
East, and takes its name from the river Phasis,
in Colchis, Asia Minor, whence it was first
brought to Europe by the Argonauts. The
pheasant is one of the most beautiful of all
fowls, and can only be rivalled by the peacock.
The shifting hues upon his neck, and the brilliant
scarlet and black around his head, strike every
beholder with admiration. Pheasants are very
good to eat, but sportsmen are not allowed to
shoot them until the 1st of October, in order
that they may have time to rear their young.
In ancient times the pheasant was held in reverence
by the heathen, and it was only on the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
solemn occasions that they were used as food, and
then only by the emperors of Rome. There are
no pheasants in America, and, on account of their
short wings and heavy bodies, they never fly from
one country to another. But they increase very
rapidly in number, a single pair having been
known to produce as many as 183 eggs in a
season. The sportsman, however, takes care to
keep their numbers within due limits. Their
habit of squatting or sitting so close to the earth,
has been supposed to be an instinctive act to save
themselves from the attacks of the hawk, who is
unable to master his prey, if large and strong,
near the ground, where it could offer resistance.
I have met with a story of a pheasant which
proves that this bird is very bold and courageous.
"A young lady walking alone a few miles from
Stirling (in Scotland), observed a beautiful cock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
pheasant perched on a stone by the road side.
Instead of showing timidity at her approach, he
flew down upon her, and, with spurs and beak,
began a furious assault. Being closely pursued,
and seeing no way of escape from the enraged
bird, she adopted the only alternative that was
left, namely, of seizing her adversary, whom she
carried home, but soon afterwards released; on
the door being opened, however, he went out
without any sign of fear, and, with a deliberate
step, paced backwards and forwards in front of
the house, and manifested an inclination to join
the fowls in the poultry yard. It should be remarked
that the young lady, when attacked, wore
a scarlet mantle, which probably excited the
irritability of the pheasant, as it is well known
to do that of the turkey-cock, and some other
animals."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Wild pheasants feed on grain, seed, green
leaves, and insects. They have been seen as eager
as country children after the ripe blackberries in
the hedges, or, later in the year, after sloes and
haws. The root of the buttercup is also a very
favourite food of the pheasant, and they will eat
greedily of acorns. When kept in confinement,
the young birds require very careful feeding with
ants' eggs, and many other kinds of soft provision.</p>

THE FLAMINGO.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE FLAMINGO.</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Is</span> not this a beautiful bird, though rather singular
in its appearance? To see it in perfection
we should have to travel at least as far as Sardinia,
and possibly to Africa, its native country. Observe
its wonderfully long and slender legs. They are
so formed as to enable it to wade into morasses,
or even rivers, in quest of food, but it can also
swim, when so disposed, being perfectly web-footed.
The beak of the flamingo is not less remarkable
than its legs, and it seems puzzling, until
we know the truth, how the bird can gather up its
food from mud and water, with that awkward
turned-in bill. But the fact is, that the flamingo
feeds very differently to other birds, turning the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
back of its head to the ground, and spooning up
the mud or water in which it finds its sustenance
with the upper mandible. It is able to do this
very easily from the unusual length of its neck,
and the beak is provided with the means of filtering
the mud, as I told you that of the duck is
also. But in this instance the apparatus provided
is said to act more like the whalebone sieve possessed
by the whale. The brilliant plumage of
the flamingo is very beautiful. M. de la Marmora,
in his "Voyage to Sardinia," speaks in great admiration
of the effect produced by a flock of
flamingoes in the air. These birds are gregarious&mdash;that
is, they live in large companies, and when
returning from Africa to the borders of a lake,
which is one of their favourite haunts, near
Cagliari, all the inhabitants are attracted by the
splendour of their appearance. Like a triangular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
band of fire in the air, they gradually come onwards,
until within sight of the lake. Poised on
the wing for an instant, they hang motionless
over the end of their weary flight; then, by a
slow circular movement, they trace a spiral descent
and range themselves like a line of soldiers in
battle array upon the borders of the lake. But no
one dares approach them more nearly, for the air
from the lake is at this season, though perfectly
harmless to the flamingo, deadly poison to a human
creature.</p>

<p>Taught by God, the flamingo has, however,
another means of security than the malaria from
the intrusion which its brilliant colouring would
be sure to draw upon it. In other respects, besides
its red coat, it has been compared to the soldier.
When feeding or resting (which they do
on one leg, the other drawn up close to the body,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and the head under the wing), the flamingoes are
drawn up in lines, and sentinels, very watchful
ones too, are placed to guard these shy and
cautious birds. At the first appearance of danger,
the sentinel flamingo utters a loud cry, much resembling
the sound of a trumpet, upon which the
whole flock instantly takes flight, and always in
the form of a triangle.</p>

<p>Do not you think sitting on her eggs must be
rather cramping work for the flamingo with those
long legs? But I will tell you how cleverly she
contrives. Instead of building a nest on the
ground, where she would find it impossible to
cower closely enough over her eggs to keep them
warm, the flamingo heaps up a hill of earth so
high, that she can sit comfortably upon it with
her long legs dangling, one on each side. At the
top is a hollow just large enough to hold her two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
or three white eggs. A full-grown flamingo stands
between five and six feet high. There is another
species of this bird much smaller, called the little
flamingo. The Romans ate these birds, and
Heliogabalus, the profane Emperor, delighted in
a dish of their tongues, which are large, considering
the size of the bird. In modern times,
however, the flesh is rejected as fishy, but the
feathers are highly valued.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE SWAN.</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">You</span> are no doubt well acquainted with this
beautiful bird, and have perhaps fed some of its
species, by the ornamental waters of the parks.
Or perhaps, and that is far better, you have seen
it sailing majestically down the river Thames,
free and unconfined, enjoying its perfect liberty.
The swan has been called a royal bird, being
formerly regarded as the exclusive property of
the crown, and even now there are but few
exceptions to the rule. The royal swans, that is
those belonging to the Crown, are marked in a
particular manner on the bill, and every year, on
the first Monday in August, men, now called
swan-hoppers (a corruption of the old term swan-uppers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
because they went up the river after the
swans), proceed up the Thames to mark the
young swans hatched during the year. The
Dyers' Company and the Vintners' Company also
own swans in the Thames, which were granted to
them in olden times. The Vintners' mark for
their swans is a nick or notch on each side of the
beak, from which their swans have been called,
merrily, "swans with two necks" (nicks). Perhaps
you have heard of an inn, which has a swan
with two necks as a sign; now you will understand
how it came by so strange a name.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 575px;"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>
<img src="images/015.png" width="575" height="500" alt="" title="" />
THE SWAN.</div>

<p>The swan builds his nest of sticks near the
river side, generally amongst the reeds. If disturbed,
the male bird assumes a very warlike
attitude, and will attack the intruder with great
violence. The swan is a strong, powerful bird,
and I have heard of a boy whose arm was broken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
by a blow from a swan's wing, because he ventured
too near the nest. But when not sitting,
swans are harmless, gentle birds. They live to a
great age, feeding on coarse grass and water-weeds.
Young swans are called cygnets, and are
at first quite grey or light brown; they do not
become perfectly white until the beginning of the
third year. The swan is not a native of our
island, but comes originally from the East, and is,
when in a state of nature, migratory in its habits.
One species of wild swan, called the Hooper, or
Whistling Swan, spends the winter in warm
climates, sometimes flying as far south as Africa,
and returns in spring to Iceland, Norway, Lapland,
and Siberia. This bird is hunted eagerly
by the Icelanders for its soft white down. The
season chosen is the moulting time, when the
poor birds, having lost their quill feathers, are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
unable to fly away; and with trained dogs which
catch them by the neck, and little ponies which
ride them down, the swans are taken in great
numbers.</p>

<p>The Black Swan is another variety, found in
Australia. Formerly this bird was considered
very rare, but now it may be seen any day in one
or other of the parks. Swans are very particular
in not allowing their neighbours to intrude on
their domains. If a strange swan comes to that
part of the river which has been already appropriated,
he is instantly pursued and compelled to
return to his own family. Once two White Swans
attacked a poor Black Swan on the lake in the
Regent's Park, and at last drove him ashore
so exhausted that he fell dead. The White
Swans kept sailing up and down to the spot
where he fell, with every feather on end, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
apparently proud of their conquest. Swans are
fond of their young, and the mother will often
carry her young ones to another part of the river
on her back. Cygnets are good to eat, and the
corporation of Norwich, who boast this treat at
their public dinners, are bound, by some old
regulation, to present the Duke of Norfolk every
year with an immense cygnet pie.</p>

<p>The Wild Swan has a very loud call, and utters
a melancholy cry when one of the flock is killed.
The Wild Swans of Hudson's Bay furnish the
finest quills used for writing. Swans and their
eggs are still protected by several statutes, and to
steal the latter is felony.</p>

<p>I will copy for you an instance in which a swan
once showed that wonderful instinct with which
all animals are gifted by God. "Whilst sitting
on her eggs, she was one day seen to be very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
busy, collecting weeds, grasses, and other materials
to raise her nest. A farming man was
ordered to take down half a load of haulm, with
which she most industriously elevated her nest
and eggs two feet and a half. That very night
there came down a tremendous fall of rain, which
flooded all the malt-kilns, and did great damage.
<i>Man</i> made no preparation, the <i>bird</i> did. Her
eggs were above, and only just above, the water."</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE KESTREL.</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">This</span> picture represents the kestrel, one of the
smallest and most beautiful of hawks. The hawk
is a bird of prey, feeding on small birds, chickens
and mice. In order to secure his prey the hawk
holds himself suspended, as it were, in the air on
his wide spread wings, until he sees a favourable
opportunity, and then suddenly pounces down
upon his victim. Other birds well know the
predatory habits of the hawk, and when one
appears in sight they fly with loud screams of
fear. Little chickens throw themselves upon
their backs, if one hovers over the poultry yard,
from some instinctive notion of defending themselves
with their feet, whilst all the hens shriek<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
in concert, and prepare for a desperate defence.
But though so great an enemy of young poultry,
a singular instance is recorded of a hawk, which
not only sat upon the eggs of a common fowl,
but even attended with great care to the little
ones when they were hatched.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 528px;"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>
<img src="images/016.png" width="528" height="500" alt="" title="" />
THE KESTREL.</div>

<p>Many of the different kinds of hawk were used
in olden times for a sport called hawking. That
is, they were trained to fly at game and return
with it to their masters. Large gay parties of
ladies and gentlemen used then to go out on
horseback with their hawks for a day's sport,
just as now they go for a pic-nic, or a day in the
woods. This was before guns were used. But
to this day hawking is practised in China, where
the emperor goes on "sporting excursions with
his grand falconer and a thousand of inferior
rank; every bird having a silver plate fastened to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
its foot, with the name of the falconer who has
the charge of it." The bird used on these occasions
is the species known as the Gos-hawk, which
was always with us most highly esteemed in
falconry. These birds were carried on the wrist,
bells were hung to their legs, and their heads
were hooded or covered until the moment came
for letting them fly at the game. Whilst under
training a string was fastened to them that they
might be "reclaimed," as it was called, at the
pleasure of their owners. The person, who carried
the hawk, wore gloves to protect his hand from
the sharp talons of the bird. The kestrel migrates
in autumn, going away at the same time with the
larks, which are its favourite food.</p>

<p>The Sparrow-hawk is a larger and fiercer bird,
and the one that preys most frequently on chickens.
A gentleman once missed a great many chickens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
from his poultry yard, and, after a little careful
watching, he found the plunderer was none other
than a large, hungry Sparrow-hawk. To catch
the thief, he ordered a net to be hung up in such
a way that the hawk in his next visit could not
fail to be entangled. The net was hung, the
thief was caught, and, in order to punish the
murderer as he deserved, the gentleman gave him
over to the tender mercies of the brood hens
whose families he had desolated. That he might
be helpless in their hands, his wings and talons
were cut, and a cork was put on his beak. The
cries and screams of the bereaved mothers were
said, by Mr. White, the charming naturalist of
Selborne, to be wonderfully expressive of rage,
fear, and revenge; they flew upon him in a body,
they "upbraided&mdash;they execrated&mdash;they insulted&mdash;they
triumphed&mdash;in a word they never desisted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
from buffeting their adversary until they had torn
him in a hundred pieces."</p>

<p>The Hawk is very bold. Mr. P. John tells of
one that he found calmly plucking the feathers of
a large pigeon on the drawing-room floor, having
followed the poor bird through the open window
into the room and there killed it. And another
actually chased a pigeon through the glass of his
"drawing-room window, out at the other end of
the house through another window, not at all
scared by the clattering of the broken glass."</p>

THE VULTURE.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE VULTURE.</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">This</span> strange looking bird is also a bird of prey;
but it feeds generally on dead carcases or offal.
There are several kinds of vulture. The largest
of all birds of prey is the Condor, a South American
species. There is also the King Vulture, a
native of the same country, called so not from its
size, for it is the smallest of the race, but from its
elegant plumage. Mr. Waterton, the naturalist,
relates a little story of a King Vulture, which
seems to show that, though so much smaller, this
bird is regarded with some degree of reverence by
the common vultures. He says that "the carcase
of a large snake, which he had killed in the
forest, becoming putrid, about twenty of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
common vultures came and perched in the neighbouring
trees; amongst them came also the King
of the Vultures; and he observed that none of the
common ones seemed inclined to begin breakfast
till his majesty had finished. When he had consumed
as much snake as nature informed him
would do him good, he retired to the top of a high
mora-tree, and then all the common vultures fell
to, and made a hearty meal." Mr. Waterton also
observed that the day after the planter had burnt
the trash in a cane-field, the King Vulture might
be seen feeding on the snakes, lizards, and frogs,
which had suffered in the conflagration. Indeed
the vulture is of real service in this respect, for
he clears the carrion away from the hot countries
he inhabits, which would otherwise putrify and
infect the air. In some places, as at Paramaribo,
the value of these birds, on this account, is so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
fully recognized, that they are protected by law,
a fine being imposed on him who kills one.</p>

<p>The vulture is to be found in almost all hot
countries. A traveller in Abyssinia speaks of
having seen them hovering, as a black cloud, over
an army of soldiers, in numbers like the sands of
the sea. After a battle they come sweeping
down to feed upon the slain. Indeed they prefer
dead to living food, and must be endowed with a
wonderfully keen sense of sight or smell, the
former is thought most likely, as no sooner does
a beast of burden drop in the deserts exhausted
on the sands, than vultures begin to make their
way towards the carcase. Whence they come
none can tell, and the only probable suggestion is
that they hover at a height beyond the ken of
human eye over a passing caravan, for they are
first noticed as specks in the air above, moving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
slowly round in circles as they descend spirally
upon their prey.</p>

<p>These birds are most voracious, gorging themselves
with as much as they can possibly contrive
to swallow. They are also very strong and
difficult to kill, one of the condors having been
known to walk about after it had been strangled
and hung on a tree with a lasso for several
minutes, and to keep on its legs after receiving
three balls from a pistol.</p>

<p>The vulture is wonderfully fitted by nature for
the part it has to fill as "scavenger" abroad, this
being the name they often go by. It is large and
strong, so that the carcase of a horse or a buffalo
is not too much for it to attack. Its legs are
strong, but not armed with sharp claws like those
of birds that feed on living prey. Its wings are
long and wide, and its bones, though thick,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
unusually light, so that the bird can remain an
immense time poised in the highest regions of the
atmosphere. Its beak is strong and hooked, and
remarkably well formed for tearing or dividing,
and what is still more noticeable, the head and
neck which, from the disgusting nature of its food,
must often be buried in unclean carcases, are
quite, or very nearly, destitute of feathers, which,
in such a situation, would be soon covered with
dirt or blood, and could not be kept clean by the
bird's own bill. The smell of vultures is, as may
be supposed, very offensive, and they are altogether
very disagreeable birds to have anything to do
with; but they are appointed to fill a particular
office in the world, and are found invaluable in
performing it.</p>

<p>The largest vultures are fifteen or sixteen feet
from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
even when not stretched to the utmost, and four
feet from beak to tail. Its legs are as thick as a
man's wrist, and its middle claw seven inches
long. They bring forth their young on the tops
of inaccessible rocks, in sunny regions, more than
twelve thousand feet above the level of the sea.</p>

<p>The European Vulture dwells amongst the
Alps, but flies as far as the mountains of Africa
and Asia. It is not so large as the condor, seldom
exceeding the size of an eagle.</p>

THE COCKATOO (OR PARROT).</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE PARROT.</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Now</span> I have to talk to you of much prettier birds,
though, alas! to tell the truth, not half so useful
as the disgusting vulture of whom we have been
speaking. This picture represents a cockatoo, one
of the parrot tribe, of which there are at least
250 species, including, besides this, the parrot,
macaw, lory, parrakeet, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Parrots are all, for the most part, tropical birds,
and in their native climates the most numerous
of the feathered tribes. There, amongst brilliant
creepers and dazzling sunshine, the "parrots
swing like blossoms on the trees."</p>

<p>The foot of the parrot is formed for climbing,
being, as Linn&aelig;us would say, <i>scansorial</i>, that is,
with two toes forwards and two backwards. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
strong hooked beak is also used as a third foot in
climbing, very much as the long tail of a monkey
helps him in flinging himself from one branch to
another.</p>

<p>They fly often in large flocks, and are killed
and eaten as food. Indeed they are so destructive
to the farmer's crops, that he kills them in self-defence.
Do you know the pretty little Australian
singing parrot, about as large as a yellow hammer,
green and gold coloured? Well, I was told by a
gentleman that he once ate part of a pudding
which contained at least thirty of these little
creatures, for each of which here one would have
to pay heavily enough, and be only too anxious to
take every care of afterwards to preserve it alive.</p>

<p>The cockatoo is also found in New Holland,
and is chiefly remarkable for its beautiful sulphur
coloured crest. The finest macaws come from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
South America; they are larger than parrots, and
have magnificent plumage of blue, crimson, green
and yellow. Seen in their native land in large
flocks they are said to resemble a flying rainbow.
Lories are so called from their frequently repeating
the word lory. The grey African Parrot is the
best speaker, for I need not tell you how closely
almost all kinds of parrot can imitate the human
voice. None imitate so closely as this, the
plainest in its personal appearance. It seems to
take pains to learn, but prefers being taught by
children. Very many amusing stories are told of
its docility and sagacity. A very clever man
tells of one that was introduced to Prince Maurice
in a room in Brazil, where he was in company
with several Dutchmen. The bird immediately
exclaimed in the Brazilian language, "What a
company of white men is here." Being asked,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
"Who is that man?" (pointing to the Prince) it
answered, "Some general or other." When asked,
"Where do you come from?" it replied, "From
Marignan." "To whom do you belong?"
"To a Portuguese." The Prince then asked,
"What do you do there?" it answered, "I look
after the chickens." The Prince, laughing, exclaimed,
"You look after the chickens!" "Yes,"
says Poll, "I can, I know very well how to do it,"
clucking at the same time like a hen calling her
brood. We are told also of a parrot that learned
to repeat the Apostles' Creed quite perfectly, and
on that account was bought by a cardinal for
100 crowns.</p>

<p>The bite of a parrot is very violent, so that
unless assured they are good tempered you will
do well not to approach a strange bird too closely.
The cause of this power in the beak is that, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
order to enable it to climb about more easily, the
upper mandible, or bone, instead of forming a
continuation as it were of the skull bone, as in
other birds, is united by a membrane which enables
it to raise or depress the beak at its pleasure. This
gives much greater force to its power of grasping.
Parrots do not build nests nor hatch young in
this country, but they thrive abundantly, and,
when well treated, show no symptoms of pining.</p>

<p>There are some very pretty little birds of the
parrot tribe called love-birds, from their affectionate
nature. They are quite worthy of the
name, as they show the utmost tenderness for
each other, both in health and sickness.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE LAPWING.</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">This</span> little bird which is often called the Pewit, from
its uttering frequently a cry resembling the sound
of this word, builds its nest or rather lays its
eggs, for it builds no regular nest, amongst long
grass or heather on open downs. If any one goes
near the nest, the watchful mother, who knows
herself too weak to defend her young, tries by all
manner of artful contrivances to draw away the
stranger's attention. She will hover close to his
ear screaming, or else flutter along the ground
as if wounded and unable to fly. And when by
this means she has drawn aside the feet of the
passer-by to some distance, she will suddenly rise
in the air and return to her nest. The eggs of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
this bird are eagerly sought after as an article of
food, so she is naturally driven to try her utmost
to secure her nest from intruders. In Scotland
formerly the Lapwing was very abundant, and
there exists a curious old act of the Scotch parliament
passed before England and Scotland were
as friendly as they are now, encouraging the
destruction of the Lapwing "as an ungrateful
bird, which came to Scotland to breed, and then
returned to England to feed the enemy." Worms
are their favourite food, but being unable to pierce
the ground with their weak, short beaks they are
ingenious enough to have recourse to the expedient
of tapping on the earth with their bills.
The earth-worm, who is very sensitive of danger,
comes up in alarm from his quaking habitation,
and is instantly pounced upon by the attentive
lapwing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 517px;"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>
<img src="images/019.png" width="517" height="500" alt="" title="" />
THE LAPWING.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>This bird is easily tamed, and I will conclude
with an account of one kept by a clergyman, that
is related by Professor Rennie. "It lived chiefly
on insects, but, as the winter drew on these failed,
and necessity compelled the poor bird to approach
the house, from which it had previously remained
at a distance, and a servant, hearing its feeble cry,
as if it were asking charity, opened for it the door
of the back kitchen. It did not venture far at first,
but it became daily more familiar and emboldened
as the cold increased, till at length it actually entered
the kitchen, though already occupied by a dog and
a cat. By degrees it at length came to so good an
understanding with these animals, that it entered
regularly at nightfall, and established itself at the
chimney corner, where it remained snugly beside
them for the night; but as soon as the warmth of
spring returned, it preferred roosting in the garden,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
though it resumed its place at the chimney
corner the ensuing winter. Instead of being
afraid of its two old acquaintances, the dog and
cat, it now treated them as inferiors, and arrogated
to itself the place which it had previously obtained
by solicitation. This interesting pet was at last
choked by a bone which it had swallowed."</p>

<p>When its eggs are laid, the pewit will fight
fiercely with any other of its species which comes
too near it. Mr. P. John saw one attack a
wounded bird which came near his nest. "The
pugnacious little fellow ran up to the intruder,
and, taking advantage of his weakness, jumped on
him, trampling upon him, and pecking at his
head, and then dragging him along the ground
as fiercely as a game-cock."</p>
